# AutoHDR
AutoHDR addon and effect for ReShade

To install add a ReShade add on path that points to the root of this repository on your local hard disk.  Alternatively copy AutoHDR.fx, AutoHDR32.addon and AutoHDR64.addon to a ReShade add on path location.

This add on is ideally intended to be used with the Sony Megatron CRT shader which can be found alongside this repository on my GitHub page.
