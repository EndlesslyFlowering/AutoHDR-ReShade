# AutoHDR (modified)
AutoHDR addon for ReShade v5.9.2 (and later?).

This modified version adds support for scRGB and removes setting the HDR metadata as it is no longer recommended.

***This addon is not safe to use with games that have Anti-Cheat!***

## Installation
- get the latest ReShade version **with full add-on support** from [here](https://reshade.me/#download) and install it for the game of your choice
- download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/EndlesslyFlowering/AutoHDR-ReShade/releases/latest)
- copy depending on the game either `AutoHDR64.addon` or `AutoHDR32.addon` to where the ReShade ini files are in the game folder
- use either inverse tone mapping from my [ReShade HDR Shaders](https://github.com/EndlesslyFlowering/ReShade_HDR_shaders/) or [PumboAutoHDR](https://github.com/Filoppi/PumboAutoHDR/) to convert SDR to HDR (ignore the part about dxvk in "How to use")
- have fun :)
